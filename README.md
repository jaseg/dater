DATER - ANOTHER useless IRC bot.
================================

When you ask DATER to characterise something, dater asks willi for the karma of that thing. After doing that, dater does some transformations on that number putting it into relation to other karma numbers. After that, three words with a corresponding happiness value are looked up in an epic, crowd-sourced table and DATER replies with the result in IRC.
